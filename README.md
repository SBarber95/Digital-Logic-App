# Sovereign Logic

> A Vue.js project

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).

## Known Issues

The recent restructuring of the project to single file Vue.js templates has caused some odd behavior with the circuit design
feature.

Restructuring has also caused site-wide CSS issues which will be addressed during the transition to Material Bootstrap.
