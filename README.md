## Known Issues

Delete component needs to be implemented, but will be done so after enough of the application restructuring is completed.

Restructuring has also caused site-wide CSS issues which will be addressed during the transition to Material Bootstrap. This is now in progress.

Various UX improvements need to be made, especially in the circuit design feature. The list of proposed changes will be placed in a wiki page in the near future.

Input validation needs to be improved for a couple of conversion features like octal, hex, and IEEE conversions.
